# Online Voting System using Blockchain Technology
Government spends a lot of capital for the voting purpose. In today's tech era, where everything is digitalized, we have to take a step forward and adapt online voting solution for voting purposes, where voter can vote from remotely anywhere through the internet.

The smartcontract developed for online voting system uses blockchain technology to make voting system much more secure and efficient. With the help of blockchain technology, the voting data is decentralized and immutable. That makes this smartcontract very secure and special. Since, blockchain is decentralized and immutable property, no one can manipulate or play with the voting data.
